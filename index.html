                <p>The Military World Games were held in the now-infamous city of Wuhan from October 18 to October 27, 2019, just before the Covid pandemic erupted around the world.</p>
                <p>Many of the 9,308 athletes representing 109 countries who participated in the Games — among the most healthy and fit members of the human population — came back with flu symptoms. Now, a new report suggests that they may have been deliberately infected with Covid.</p>
                <p>The <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjenniferzeng97%2Fstatus%2F1676572097353510914&data=05%7C01%7Cdbean%40lifesitenews.com%7C3c5338239e0e48b8e96308db7e5cb93e%7Cb1de1e02454440878df20244507fd8e6%7C1%7C0%7C638242710219712609%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=F%2BeOZmp0qwqkhKaKM9Sc2Rn%2Bp5Zk%2FujVeykRS1GT5iE%3D&reserved=0"> report</a> comes from Jennifer Zeng, a Chinese dissident journalist who interviewed an informant close to Dr. Shan Chao (单超 ), who serves as the deputy director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s high containment lab.</p>
                <p>According to the informant, Dr. Shan relayed that he had been given four variants of SARS-CoV-2 in February 2019 by his boss and was asked to determine which one was the most infectious to humans. These “bioweapons” — as he called them — were not natural variants but had been engineered in the lab, he said.</p>
                <p>Dr. Shan further reported that several of his colleagues were absent from their regular workstations during the 2019 Military World Games in Wuhan. One later explained to him that they had been sent ostensibly to “check the hygiene conditions” of the hotels where the athletes were staying, but that their real purpose was the spread the coronavirus that he had identified as most infectious.</p>
                <p>Zeng’s informant’s <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jenniferzengblog.com%2Fhome%2F2023%2F6%2F27%2Ftranscript-i-was-given-4-strains-of-coronavirus-to-select-the-most-infectious-wiv-researcher-shao-chao-says&data=05%7C01%7Cdbean%40lifesitenews.com%7C3c5338239e0e48b8e96308db7e5cb93e%7Cb1de1e02454440878df20244507fd8e6%7C1%7C0%7C638242710219712609%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=g7u1wKNuOKmIkKZaVoAWtDORfC8zT9N5suyNzxp5O2g%3D&reserved=0"> exact words</a> were, “One of the guys was asked to inoculate people from other countries during the event so that they can be infected and carry the pathogen back to the country they came from with only minor symptoms, which is pretty common in late autumn.”</p>

                <p>Now all of this comports well with evidence I first reported in my The Politically Incorrect Guide to Pandemics, where I wrote that “Sources in China have not only confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not only a product of the lab, but also that by early 2019 it was ready to be deployed against human subjects, … As first reported by Dr. Lawrence Sellin, scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology were involved in testing the transmissibility of the China Virus in monkeys, a coronavirus release and response drill at Wuhan’s Tianhe airport in September 2019, and an actual release of COVID-19 at the 2019 Military World Games from October 18–27, 2019. According to Dr. Sellin’s source, this was intended to be a small, short-term test release of Covid-19, and special health screenings of the athletes would be used to monitor the results.”</p>
                <p>Well-known Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng has <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Farticle-10014895%2FEx-Chinese-Communist-Party-insider-Wei-Jingsheng-speaks-Wuhan-theory-relating-Covid-19.html&data=05%7C01%7Cdbean%40lifesitenews.com%7C3c5338239e0e48b8e96308db7e5cb93e%7Cb1de1e02454440878df20244507fd8e6%7C1%7C0%7C638242710219712609%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=AVjzvJlqlkeMHTWLTgranOIkPcPAVZkIz%2BndNCaQcdY%3D&reserved=0"> independently confirmed</a> from his own sources in China that the virus was intentionally released on the athletes at the Games.</p>
                <p>Some of visiting athletes later recounted having fallen ill in Wuhan, and how they had to be quarantined during and after their return flights to their home countries. Canadian athletes were apparently <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsundayguardianlive.com%2Fnews%2Fvirus-cover-china-stockpiled-worlds-supply-ppes&data=05%7C01%7Cdbean%40lifesitenews.com%7C3c5338239e0e48b8e96308db7e5cb93e%7Cb1de1e02454440878df20244507fd8e6%7C1%7C0%7C638242710219712609%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=dNm5W%2FBfbwAJH6Xy%2FKfTRv8ZMrZAFzyYNCaQNoACGJg%3D&reserved=0"> especially hard hit</a>, with about one-quarter of Canada’s team falling so ill during their sojourn in Wuhan that they were quarantined in the back of the plane on their return flight to Canada.</p>

It is strange that so many extremely fit young people would fall ill at once, unless they were deliberately infected.</p>
                <p>Indeed, as part of their effort to blame the U.S. for the pandemic, the Chinese authorities themselves <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2021%2F08%2F06%2Fchina%2Fchina-covid-origin-mic-intl-hnk%2Findex.html&data=05%7C01%7Cdbean%40lifesitenews.com%7C3c5338239e0e48b8e96308db7e5cb93e%7Cb1de1e02454440878df20244507fd8e6%7C1%7C0%7C638242710219712609%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=6Dj0rdY2Q9oAw9GN1BZL%2FDfiFItgd8zuP9DJ%2FmaM9RI%3D&reserved=0"> inadvertently confirmed</a> that Covid <i>was spread</i> at the Wuhan games, although they attempted to blame U.S. athletes for bringing it in.</p>
                <p>As Dr. Sellin’s source <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegatewaypundit.com%2F2021%2F07%2Freport-deliberate-release-covid-19-chinese-military%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cdbean%40lifesitenews.com%7C3c5338239e0e48b8e96308db7e5cb93e%7Cb1de1e02454440878df20244507fd8e6%7C1%7C0%7C638242710219712609%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=bhCQAovQSEG1FpLBs5o9Kg211TBmQNT187mHFzR7y44%3D&reserved=0"> explained</a>, “The release of COVID-19 at the Military World Games was also a test of the longer-term effects of that type of bioweapon because foreign visitors to the Games would carry it back to their own countries and the consequences could be observed. … [T]he subsequent outbreak in Wuhan was entirely unexpected. That is, there was no laboratory leak, but the unintended spread among the Chinese population of Wuhan of a virus for which they had underestimated its transmissibility.”</p>
                <p>There is no doubt about what happened next: Once China itself was unexpectedly in the grip of Covid, the CCP in desperation used its own people as “human disease vectors” to speed the release of its “unrestricted bioweapon” on the world.</p>
                <p>Corrupt Joe Biden will, of course, never call the Chinese Communist Party to account for any of this, since he has been compromised by Communist money.</p>
                <p>Donald Trump, however, has promised to do just that.</p>
